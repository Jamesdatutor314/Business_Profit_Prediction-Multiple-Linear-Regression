# Business Profit Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression

By James Weaver & Amy Rodriguez

Project: "MAT_326___Finance_Firms.pdf"

# Introduction
Translated business profit prediction problem into solvable machine learning challenge by leveraging economic variables, revealing average profit per shareholder equity, advertising-to-sales ratio, and market shares as the most influential factors to profit by using the R program language.

# Files
The "MAT_326__Finance_Firms.pdf" is a thorough investigation into finance firms. The heart of the project lies within "project2.ipynb", an R-based Jupyter Notebook that delves into data analysis, visualization, and various computational tasks. This content was synthesized into "project2.pdf", offering a more concise rendition of the notebook's findings for ease of reference. Moreover, the "project2.r" file presents the project's main analytical scripts in R, ensuring that the developed models and analytical procedures are readily accessible for further research or implementation.

# Analysis
- Iterated through 64 possible models to identify the optimal model with R^2 of 0.86 while minimizing Type I errors.
- Validated model assumptions (linearity, independence, normality, and homoscedasticity) and significance
(hypotheses test on coefficients).
- Identified outliers utilizing standardized jackknives, cooks, and leverage residuals.
