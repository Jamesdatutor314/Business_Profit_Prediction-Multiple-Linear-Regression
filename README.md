# Business Profit Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression

By James Weaver & Amy Rodriguez

Project: "MAT_326___Finance_Firms.pdf"

# Introduction
Translated business profit prediction problem into solvable machine learning challenge by leveraging economic variables, revealing average profit per shareholder equity, advertising-to-sales ratio, and market shares as the most influential factors to profit by using the R program language.

# Files
The "Data_Science_KNN_Project.pdf" represents a comprehensive documentation of a project that delved into the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, a cornerstone in machine learning. Diving deeper, "Project2 Data Science-Copy1.ipynb" is an interactive Jupyter Notebook that showcases the data science workflow, from initial data exploration to model deployment, using Python. This notebook was further distilled into the "Project2 Data Science-Copy2.pdf", which provides a more streamlined view suitable for quick referencing. Lastly, the "Project2 Data Science-Copy2.py" is a versatile Python script derived from the notebook, facilitating more direct implementations of the techniques demonstrated in the project. The file folder contains the datasets that were used.

# Analysis
- Iterated through 64 possible models to identify the optimal model with R^2 of 0.86 while minimizing Type I errors.
- Validated model assumptions (linearity, independence, normality, and homoscedasticity) and significance
(hypotheses test on coefficients).
- Identified outliers utilizing standardized jackknives, cooks, and leverage residuals.
